# 🌳 THE GATHERING TREE

## Brand Story

> *"In villages across Africa and the Middle East, the tree has always been where people gather - to learn from elders, to share wisdom, to grow together as a community. The shade of the tree is where knowledge is passed from generation to generation.*
>
> *Lamma+ is that tree for the digital age.*
>
> *A gathering place for seekers of knowledge, no matter where they are. Under one tree, we come together."*
